				<p id="p4">Pokémon Go is a location-based augmented reality game developed by Niantic for iOS and Android devices. In the game, players use a mobile device's GPS capability to locate, capture, battle, and train virtual creatures, called Pokémon, who appear on the screen as if they were in the same real-world location as the player.
				As players move within their real world surroundings, their avatar moves within the game's map. 
				<br>Different Pokémon species reside in different areas of the world; for example, water-type Pokémon are generally found near water. When a player encounters a Pokémon, they may view it either in augmented reality (AR) mode or with a live rendered, generic background.</p>
