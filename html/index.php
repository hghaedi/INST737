				<p id="p2">Research questions:</p>
				<p id="p3">1.Where Pokémon appear in future?</p>
				<p id="p4">Although Pokémon Go’s user base has been declining relatively sharply in recent months, this gaming app is still minor milestone for augmented reality technology and application. Through Pokémon Go, AR/VR became a mainstream phenomenon before most industry insider and early adopters thought it would. Therefore, by reviewing hundreds of thousands records of Pokémon historical sighting and relative information, including weather condition, geo-information, etc., we are hoping to predict the appearances of Pokémons in future.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p id="p3">2.What are the Pokémon segments?</p>
				<p id="p4">Through our own experience of playing Pokémon Go, we found there is a very interesting phenomenon that certain Pokémon share a same appearance pattern based on their popularity degree, class, etc. For example, Pidgey and Rattata could be found everywhere, especially around farmland and forests, while some Pokémon of water class may only be detected around lake and river. We would like to find out the Pokémon segments based on the datasets of “Predict’em All” and “Rare Pokémon List”.</p>
				<br>
				<p id="p2">Data collection:</p>
				<p id="p4"> 1.The Pokémon Go dataset (“Predict’em All”) includes 293,000 Pokémon historical sighting records and 25 features. (Info. on hold: Period of time...) The data were collected from online services like PokeRadar. These online services work like “radars” that simulate countless virtual devices in different locations and send back the real-time data of Pokémon appearances. </p>
				<br>
				<p id="p4"> 2.The “Rare Pokémon List” includes the rarity information of 151 Pokémons, ranges from “Common” to “Super Rare”. Each row includes a hyperlink to a Pokémon’s specific information, like possible spawn locations. </p>
